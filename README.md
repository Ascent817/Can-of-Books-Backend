What to do if someone is slacking while the other is pulling all the weight - 

communicate, if problem persists bring it up to TA or instructor

What to do if someone is taking  over and not letting others contribute - 

communicate and once again if the problem persists, bring it up with TA or instructor
 
Chosen approach for the challenge of building an application with partners of differing skill level and understanding

 - enable harmonious collaboration while leaving room and giving opportunity for 
 each other to learn
